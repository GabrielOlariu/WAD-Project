<review>It's more than just a return to form for Pixar; "Inside Out" might be one the best films they've ever made.</review>

<review>A melancholy minor masterpiece of dreamy originality, Inside Out is among Pixar's finest.</review>

<review>[Inside Out] converts complex concepts -- like memory, subconcious, dreams and imagination -- into a visual game, a psychology lesson for both children and adults.</review>

<review>Warner Bros. would have been better off sticking with the film's original March release date and selling it as a horror movie.</review>

<review>If you want a Ron Howard movie about a man obsessed with a creature from the deep, "In the Heart of the Sea," sadly, is not the place to start. Try "Splash."</review>

<review>Director Ron Howard has created a maritime redux of his other explorers' epic, Apollo 13; both of the films are about men at the mercy of technologies that help them traverse dangerous places.</review>

<review>The story quickly grew predictable and bland, and the design of the ghosts and the role they played in the story left me feeling disappointed.</review>

<review>Crimson Peak is the perfect film for that small subgroup of moviegoers that doesn't see shivers and manic giggling as incompatible.</review>

<review>I think film culture would be much poorer if it looked away from this deliciously mordant work by del Toro, one of the few writer-directors today who don't just craft images but think in them.</review>

<review>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is not the action movie of the summer -- but it's the one I enjoyed the most.</review>

<review>The re-invention might have been better as straight-up thriller. More story and less comedy fails would have helped.</review>

<review>The main problem with The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is its tone. We can't take this stuff seriously, yet Ritchie misses all sorts of opportunities to make the movie fun. The result isn't particularly satisfying as either adventure or comedy.</review>
