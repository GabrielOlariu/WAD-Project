		<Comments>The Revenant is among the truly great films of 2015, and is Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu's greatest film... by the end you share in the characters' exhaustion of heart and soul, and perhaps in their glimpse at something infinite, beautiful, and terrifying.</Comments>

		<Comments>The story quickly grew predictable and bland, and the design of the ghosts and the role they played in the story left me feeling disappointed.</Comments>

		<Comments>The re-invention might have been better as straight-up thriller. More story and less comedy fails would have helped.</Comments>
