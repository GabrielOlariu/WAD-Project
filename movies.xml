		<Comments>The Revenant is among the truly great films of 2015, and is Alejandro Gonzaezel Inarritu&apos;s greatest film... by the end you share in the characters&apos; exhaustion of heart and soul, and perhaps in their glimpse at something infinite, beautiful, and terrifying.</Comments>

		<Comments>The story quickly grew predictable and bland, and the design of the ghosts and the role they played in the story left me feeling disappointed.</Comments>

		<Comments>Warner Bros. would have been better off sticking with the film&apos;s original March release date and selling it as a horror movie.</Comments>

		<Comments>The re-invention might have been better as straight-up thriller. More story and less comedy fails would have helped.</Comments>
